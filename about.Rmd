The present study used data from the Middle School Success Project, a longitudinal randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of a version of the KEEP SAFE program for pre-adolescent girls in foster care (Chamberlain, Leve, & Smith, 2006). 

The literature suggests that adverse events that foster youth experience during childhood may uniquely shape youthâ€™s decision-making. In this project I intend to investigate the effects of maltreatment severity and placement changes on adolescent girls' risky decision-making. Understanding this association is important because risky decision-making is associated with a host of negative outcomes for foster youth.
